colours-and-categories
----------------------

Colours are extremely useful for labelling and categorization. This snippet, geared towards iPads, allows users to create colour-genre associations. Colours are grouped in seven palettes derived from the work of L. Eisemann (Pantone's Guide to Communicating with Color, 2000).

After choosing one palette, users can map colours to genres by dragging colours from the palette and dropping them onto the desired row of the genre UITableView. The drag-and-drop procedure is enriched with feedback to enhance user's understanding of what is happening, what has just occurred and what can be done.
